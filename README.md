# Online-Railwau-Reservation-System
To make railway reservation more acceptable for travellers, an online reservation system makes it easier in booking tickets from the comfort of our homes or offices. While this is convenient for most people, it has made things particularly easier for people staying in far-off locations. The main objective of the Railway Reservation System is to handle the schedule of Train, Booking status, Payment, Seat, Ticket. The objective of the project is to put up an application program to reduce the human effort for administrating the Running Train Status, Booking, Customer, Payment.
